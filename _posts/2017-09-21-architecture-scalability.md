scale-out VS. scale-up

	Reliance on hardware versus reliance on software
	Equation with “first-class” hardware versus “commodity” hardware
	Massive versus incremental capacity increases
	Centralized versus partitioned application architectures


ap tier scaling:
	scale-out
	scale-up

db tier scaling:
	replication: scaling by duplication
	partitioning: scaling by Division
		vertical partitioning: divide data on tables/columns
		horizontal partitioning: divide data on rows

	replication/partitioning are all scale-out.

	example of scale-up:
		oracle RAC
		

	what about mysql innodb cluster and NDB cluster?
